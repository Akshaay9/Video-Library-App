    "Should you do calisthenics workout to build muscle? What's better, calithenics or lifting weights? Is your bodyweight good enough to get stronger? What I propose is that if you really want to be up in arms about it is that you go ahead and find me a calisthenics ONLY individual (which, respectfully, Medrano is not) and then I'll be happy to provide you a natural bodybuilder for comparison. And if you're still going to argue about it, then I have nothing else to share with you. Remember, this video is about whether calisthenics can build muscle (which it can), but lifting weights will clearly be a more efficient and effective route.",
