      "This is a 15 minute beginner‚Äôs daily yoga routine. With gyms and offices shutting down, this video is focussed on utilising our precious time into a higher purpose of learning yoga. If you have never practised any of the yogic postures or breathing exercises then this should be the video which will help you get started with this divine practice. Let‚Äôs not focus on the fear, panic and the noise created by the media instead channelise our energy into something like yoga which will boost your immunity and help you live a disease free life in the long run. One more thing, this is not a video to just watch but to follow along. So, c‚Äômon let us do it together.",
